# Accident-detection-system
Overview
This Accident Detection System is an advanced safety device designed to enhance vehicle safety by monitoring various parameters and promptly detecting accidents. It integrates an alcohol sensor, GSM module, GPS module, fire sensor, vibration sensor, and gesture camera, offering real-time accident detection, location tracking, and alerting capabilities. This system aims to minimize response time in emergencies and ensure timely assistance.

Features
Alcohol Sensor:

Monitors the driver's breath for alcohol levels.
Prevents vehicle ignition if alcohol is detected, reducing the risk of accidents caused by impaired driving.
GSM Module:

Sends SMS alerts to pre-configured emergency contacts in case of an accident.
Can also notify authorities or medical services with the vehicle's current location and status.
GPS Module:

Tracks and provides real-time location data of the vehicle.
Ensures accurate location information is sent during an accident, enabling faster emergency response.
Fire Sensor:

Detects the presence of fire within the vehicle.
Triggers an alert in case of a fire hazard, allowing for quick evacuation or fire suppression.
Vibration Sensor:

Senses sudden impacts or abnormal vibrations, indicative of a collision.
Activates the accident detection system and triggers alerts.
Gesture Camera:

Monitors driver gestures and can detect signs of fatigue, distraction, or sudden movements.
Triggers warnings or system interventions based on detected gestures, improving overall safety.
How It Works
Alcohol Detection:

Before starting the vehicle, the driver is required to undergo a breath test.
If alcohol is detected, the ignition system is disabled, and an alert is sent to emergency contacts via the GSM module.
Accident Detection:

The vibration sensor continuously monitors the vehicle for sudden impacts.
Upon detecting a significant impact, the system activates and collects data from all sensors (fire, GPS, gesture camera).
The system sends an alert via the GSM module, providing the vehicle’s location and status.
Fire Detection:

If the fire sensor detects smoke or fire, the system automatically triggers an alert, sending location details and fire warnings.
Real-time Monitoring:

The gesture camera continuously observes the driver’s behavior and detects abnormal gestures, such as sudden head movements or signs of fatigue.
Warnings are issued to the driver, and in severe cases, the system may alert emergency contacts.
Benefits
Early Accident Detection: Reduces response time and ensures timely medical assistance.
Prevention of Drunk Driving: The alcohol sensor helps prevent accidents caused by impaired drivers.
Accurate Location Tracking: The GPS module ensures accurate location reporting, aiding emergency services.
Comprehensive Safety Monitoring: Multiple sensors provide all-around monitoring of various accident scenarios.
User Alerts: Automatic SMS alerts keep emergency contacts informed in real-time.
Installation Instructions
Mount the Sensors:

Install the alcohol sensor near the driver’s seat for easy access.
Mount the fire and vibration sensors at strategic points within the vehicle.
Place the gesture camera to monitor the driver’s face and gestures.
Connect Modules:

Connect the GSM module to the system's control unit and ensure proper SIM card installation.
Integrate the GPS module for real-time tracking.
Power Up:

Connect the system to the vehicle’s power supply.
Perform a full system test to ensure all sensors and modules are functioning correctly.
Safety Precautions
Ensure proper calibration of the alcohol sensor for accurate readings.
Regularly test the GSM module to ensure SMS alerts are functioning.
Avoid tampering with sensor placements to ensure accurate detection.
Regular maintenance checks are recommended to keep the system in optimal working condition.
Troubleshooting
No SMS Alerts: Check GSM module connections and verify SIM card functionality.
GPS Not Working: Ensure the GPS module has a clear line of sight to the sky and is properly connected.
System Not Detecting Accidents: Inspect the vibration sensor and confirm it’s securely mounted and calibrated.
